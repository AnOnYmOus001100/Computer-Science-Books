<P><I>Everyone seems to be talking about the Net, the &quot;information </I><I>super-highway,&quot; the infobahn, the National Information Infrastructure </I><I>(NII), and the Internet. Why is this so?</I>

<BR></P>

<P><I>It seems that we see this new technology, the Internet, as a ray of </I><I>sunlight, the first light of a new Information Age. It does hold great </I><I>promise for our whole society, especially for educators and also for </I><I>learners or 
students.</I>

<BR></P>

<P><I>Teachers are asking &quot;Why should I use the Internet in my home or </I><I>classroom? Is this a good way to help children and adults prepare for a </I><I>better future?&quot; This next section is intended to begin to introduce to </I><I>you the 
many ways that education is </I><I>already</I> changing because of the Internet.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I7" NAME="I7">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>How the Internet Changes Learning</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Let's face facts&#151;the Internet is exciting. Learning while using the Net is a powerful releaser of emotion, a motivator, and a new form of engagement for many students. Students gravitate to the Net like nothing before in their lives.

<BR></P>

<P>While the Net is not likely to replace after-school athletics or music lessons very soon, for some students it is the best learning opportunity ever made available to them. These children soon realize that their rewards on the Internet will be in 
proportion to the effort they invest in learning Net skills, and learn all the more for it.

<BR></P>

<P>Contacts in far away places around the world make any project more dynamic, and more interesting. Frequently, the Internet has the most up-to-date information available anywhere. Both teachers and students are energized by the freshness and immediacy of 
the Net.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>This section cannot be a comprehensive review of all the reasons why every school should be using the Internet. Instead, it will briefly list in broad strokes how the Net is being used to accomplish important educational 
goals&#151;in some cases, goals that <I>cannot be </I><I>achieved</I> without Internet access.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>The Net <I>is</I> the future. It costs less than a high school sports program, and Internet competence will stay with students for life, because these skills are intellectual, not physical. Keyboarding is only the beginning. Kids who are connected to 
the Net learn to ask better questions, to make better arguments, and to present themselves more positively, by using the Internet as a new form of communication.

<BR></P>

<P>Let's start with e-mail. Children concentrate harder to express themselves when sending an e-mail message to another country or state. They work on vocabulary and clarity as never before. When they know another student in Stockholm, or an engineer at 
NASA, will be writing back, children recognize the difference between slang and formal language. Some evidence has been found that kids express themselves more carefully and demonstrate better communication skills while using e-mail than they do in written 
tests for their regular classroom teacher!

<BR></P>

<P>On the topic of formal language&#151;learning computer languages, that is&#151;learning to <I>program</I> computers is a tremendous mathematical learning opportunity. Computer operation has its essence in math, and truly understanding computers requires 
some fairly sophisticated mathematical and scientific concepts. Kids who become ensnared in the Net tend to &quot;automatically&quot; excel in other areas of math, science, and often surprise their teachers and parents with new knowledge far afield from 
math and science.

<BR></P>

<P>The Internet is rapidly becoming the largest reservoir of knowledge ever extant on this planet. Wise students grow adept at finding and retrieving remote Net information. They then go on to develop more sophisticated search and retrieval strategies. 
Soon, they begin to really admire librarians for their access and retrieval skills, no longer as magical <I>sources</I> of books and information.

<BR></P>

<P>Once students have gathered together masses of new information, their teachers are expected to know how to help sort out the information and deal with it constructively. This is the beginning, for students, of learning the arts of analysis, evaluation, 
and application. These writing, thinking, and knowledge skills learned on the Internet are applicable to almost every curriculum area.

<BR></P>

<P>Also, don't forget that the Net's very best resources are human beings, not computers or databases! Old friends, new friends, and experts of all types&#151;colleagues, specialists, and fellows of all stripes are on the Net, anticipating your arrival. 
Teacher, parent, and student isolation can become a thing of the past!

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Both Time and Space Seem to Disappear</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>The normal limitations of time and space do not apply to the Net. New Zealand is just as close as your state capital, in Net time. E-mail arrives in minutes, and huge files are copied and transferred thousands of miles in mere seconds.

<BR></P>

<P>Teachers use e-mail to do consultations, confident they won't have to play telephone-tag. Students can exchange several volleys with keypals before a surface mail letter can make a single<B> </B><I>one-way</I> trip.

<BR></P>

<P>Sending mail on a Listserv to hundreds or thousands of people is no more work than sending a single message&#151;the Net does the extra toil for you!

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I9" NAME="I9">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Self-Reliant Learning</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Because it is like a worldwide personal library, the Net inspires students, teachers, and parents to find and use new information.

<BR></P>

<P>Powerful Internet tools allow everyone to find and retrieve new information, data, graphic images, and software that is personally interesting, almost instantly. Often the information is simply not available except on the Internet.

<BR></P>

<P>Students also learn the importance of educational independence and intellectual autonomy from using the Net for school work.

<BR></P>

<P>The Net is more current (as in <I>instantaneous</I>) and more dynamic than any old-fashioned library could be, so students and teachers learn that using the Net can save them time. Because the Internet exhibits many of the signs of life and is so 
responsive to our information needs, some people even become attached to the Net, as they would to a dear friend.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>The Net is Color-Blind and Does Not Discriminate</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Socially induced prejudices like appearance, gender, race, age, and behaviors fade away in the world of the Internet, because students learn that they are judged solely on what they say and how they say it.

<BR></P>

<P>Hearing-impaired people may actually have an <I>advantage</I> on the Net, because they are not distracted by outside noises.

<BR></P>

<P>Class, race, ability, and disability are removed from consideration in Internet communication. They simply do not matter.

<P>Margaret Honey surveyed educators who were using telecommunications for professional and intructional activities in the spring of 1992. Respondents were described as highly self-motivated, with little support from the school or district level. A high 
percentage of the teachers reported that they were self-taught, learning from their online colleagues, and a substantial majority are &quot;conducting professional networking activities from their own homes, suggesting that much of their telecommunications 
work is now done on their own time, at their own expense, and with a high level of personal commitment.&quot; A reasonable conclusion is that this significant national movement, which only recently has gained the attention of the popular media, has sprung 
from grassroots activities fostered and sustained by dedicated professionals who see this movement as extraordinarily beneficial to themselves and their students.

<P>Janet Murray is the librarian at a comprehensive public high school serving 1,500 students in Portland, Oregon, and SysOp of the HI TECH TOOLS for Librarians BBS (FidoNet 1:105/23). She is also a cofounder of K12Net, a virtual network of 37 
educationally-oriented conferences devoted to curriculum, language exchanges with native speakers, and classroom-to-classroom projects. Since obtaining her MALS from Rosary College Graduate School of Library and Information Science in 1981, she has been an 
active advocate of online programs, making appearances and speeches at national conferences, automating circulation systems in school libraries, and bringing innovative access systems to her school district. In the following e-mail interview, she answers 
questions about K12Net and the future of the electronic school.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>Over the last few years, the word &quot;education&quot; has become a sort of rallying cry for the technologically progressive; from Internet-savvy librarians &lt;g&gt; to Hollywood &quot;Edutainment&quot; producers and Silicon Valley software 
developers. Obviously, digital storage/retrieval and advanced telecommunications are ideal for educational applications, but the bottom-line question is: &quot;Who pays for this stuff?&quot; Has this general interest translated into more financial support 
from the private and commercial sectors?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>Not in my experience. But the government's recent initiatives in funding tend to encourage local collaboration and matching funds from the private and commercial sectors, so that may be an emerging trend.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>There are many who feel that the increasing privatization of the educational industry will lead to an eventual displacement of the public school system. Do you feel this is a real possibility? And is that good news or bad news?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>First, let me quibble over a semantic issue: Do you (and others) regard education as an industry? A recent issue of the <B><I>Phi Delta Kappan </I></B>featured the privatization movement with a cover caricaturizing children as 
&quot;products&quot; emerging from an assembly line... But to respond to your first question&#151;No. Commerce is rarely altruistic. Corporations that provide education for a fee (and a profit) will attract those who can afford it to the ultimate detriment 
of those who cannot. I'm highly skeptical of the promises made by those with a vested interest in privatizing education; if there were a panacea to the perceived problems of education, it would have been discovered by now. As for your second 
question&#151;the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine forty years ago; any educational reform movement that fosters inequality is bad news. The U.S. Postal Service may provide a useful analogy; its privatization 
increased competition as well as costs. Now those who can afford Federal Express or United Parcel Service may prefer those services, but the national public system has not been displaced, and few would assert that it offers &quot;equal&quot; services.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>The Internet is regarded by many as a sort of &quot;panacea,&quot; not only for purposes of education but for all of society as well. Of course this picture may be changing; the NSF's upcoming withdrawal from management of the Internet 
backbone and the increasing &quot;privatization of cyberspace,&quot; when coupled with the traditional underfunding of the public school system, seems to imply that educators must find new ways to utilize and cross-link existing systems. Do you see this 
happening in the field?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>In 1994, there have been several initiatives to promote cooperation among federal and state agencies, network service providers, and educational practitioners. The March 1994 report, &quot;Building Consensus/Building Models: A Networking 
Strategy for Change,&quot; summarizes the recommendations derived from one such collaboration.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>How can public education make best use of the Internet (or the NII), and yet remain unbiased and egalitarian? <I>That </I>is the question&#151;.

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>The Internet/NII's capacity to offer small, isolated schools access to the same resources available in urban school districts is fundamental to questions of equity. Although 67 percent of U.S. elementary schools and 50 percent of our high 
schools serve fewer than 500 students, all of the currently funded NIE testbed sites are located in metropolitan areas. These smaller schools are typically least able to afford the high-speed networking configurations currently being recommended by the 
experts, and, paradoxically, most likely to benefit from access. We must promote networking solutions that will serve <I>all </I>schools, not just the elite few.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>This leads to K12Net, of which you are a cofounder. K12Net, which coexists on FidoNet-compatible BBSs and as a series of Usenet newsgroups in the k12.* hierarchy, is demonstrating the capabilities afforded us <I>right now</I>&#151;the 
cross-linking of networking systems for the common purpose. Since access requires only a working Fido BBS, students, teachers, and administrators from all over the world can make use of K12Net, even if they're located far from the nearest university or 
Internet access provider. What's going on these days on K12Net?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>K12Net has always described itself as a &quot;network with training wheels&quot; designed to acquaint K-12 educators and students with the benefits of telecommunications. As more schools obtain access to Internet, our participants will 
probably shift their focus to sharing information about efficient location of Internet resources. The statewide networks in California, North Dakota, and Virginia already provide their states' primary access point for K12Net through the Usenet newsgroups 
in the k12.* hierarchy. However, K12Net's status as an <I>international </I>educational network is heavily dependent on its FidoNet roots. Nearly 50 percent of the participating K12Net bulletin board systems are located outside the continental U.S., where 
K-12 educational access to Internet is highly problematic. Therefore, I do not expect K12Net to rely solely on Internet distribution in the foreseeable future.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>Are there other differences? Do the Usenet posts tend to have different purposes than those which come in from the Fido systems?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>Posts from both types of sites focus on the useful exchange of information. An important advantage of crosslinking K12Net bulletin board systems with Usenet newsgroups is that it enables university participation. Student inquiries frequently 
receive valuable responses from correspondents in research-oriented institutions.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>In terms of the future of public education and equal access to what might be called &quot;public knowledge bases&quot;&#151;the educational levels of the NII&#151;what are the most important hurdles before us?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>Affordable access and adequate training are the most significant hurdles to be surmounted by Internet enthusiasts. Rapid developments in the provision of user-friendly interfaces over the past two years have created an environment in which 
one can successfully locate materials and information appropriate in a K-12 setting. Now we must educate and persuade the service providers and telcos that it is in their best interest to provide affordable access, and we must develop training materials 
that can be used effectively and independently at remote sites.

<BR></P>

<P><B>TF: </B>And how is K12Net addressing these issues?

<BR></P>

<P><B>JM: </B>We are promoting awareness of the need for inexpensive, locally manageable networking software and training materials appropriate for use in individual schools. (Commercial solutions developed by BBSs and e-soft are prohibitively expensive 
and require longterm commitments for technical support.) Several of us are participating in local and statewide initiatives to network K-12 schools.

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> Be sure you obtain, study, and get practice with the directions for your mail program and text editor. You are responsible for the results of your use of these programs. Any failure will reflect on <I>you</I>. Your readers out

<LI>Whenever you use the Reply: function, look carefully at the outgoing address that is automatically filled in. Be sure the address shown is the person you intend to reach. Some mail programs mail your Reply: to everyone imaginable unless you notice it

<BR></LI>

<LI><I>Not including your name and e-mail address at the end of every </I><I>post.</I> Some mailer programs do not show the headers of arriving messages, which makes it difficult to reply privately to messages that lack a short &quot;signature.&quot; Often 
this newbie error contributes to others making error #1.

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> Always put at least your name and e-mail address on every piece of outgoing mail, unless you are absolutely sure all recipients know you personally, and your e-mail address. If you do not include your signature, you may 
unintentionally miss pertinent information because it's just too inconvenient for others to somehow find your address to reply.

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>If you are one of the unlucky people whose mail-reading program does not show incoming message &quot;headers,&quot; where all that important addressing and reply information is, here is a way you can trick the computer into 
telling you the address, anyway:

<BR>

<BR>Save the incoming message in question as a text file. Find the option on your mail program for saving mail as a file. Then, exit the mail program and open the file in a text editor. Viola! All the complex address information was really there all 
along&#151;your mail program just prefers to hide it from you. Why do you use such an unevolved program?

<BR>

<BR>Ask around to see if there are any better mail programs available to you. PINE is one of the very best, and it is MIME-compliant, which means you can use it to send almost any data file <I>attached</I> to your e-mail messages.

<LI><I>Sending commands meant for the Listserv robot program to all the </I><I>people on the list instead.</I> None of the people on the list can help you unsubscribe, subscribe, signoff, postpone, nomail, and so on. These clerical tasks are designed for

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> Don't send anything to all the people on the list unless it is on the defined list topic.

<BR>

<BR>There are always two different addresses for the people and the robot, and sometimes there is even another address for a human being&#151;the moderator or list owner. Use the correct address.

<BR>

<BR>The address for the clerical robot varies, because there are several different kinds of software and hardware combinations that do the mailing list clerical work. Typically, the robot's address will start with something like

<BR>

<BR>listserv@  listproc@  majordomo@  listname-request@

<LI><I>Not saving the initial &quot;welcome&quot; message everyone receives upon </I><I>subscribing to a new discussion list.</I> It contains vitally important instructions and information you <I>will</I> eventually need. No matter what kind of a list you 
subscribe to, you should save the welcome message, because you will need it later.

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> Save the initial message you get back from every list you subscribe to. You may want to print it on paper and save it in a safe place, in case of disk crashes. Gurus know that every list has little quirks that make it slightly 
different, so they save the instructions, knowing they will someday need them.

<BR>

<BR>You may need to temporarily unsubscribe from a list, for example, even though you intend to read that favorite list faithfully until the day you retire. Someday you may move and/or need to change your access account name (also called your login or 
login name). Or, if your employer supplies your Internet access, your employer may change the name of the host computer(s) at your access site. Before you move, or just before your host computer's name is changed, you should unsubscribe from all of your 
Listservs! Why?

<BR>

<BR>Well, it's because the robot at the remote Listserv site will get confused if it starts getting mail from you at a new address. It won't believe it's you because the new address does not match its careful records.

<BR>

<BR>If you don't unsubscribe and then resubscribe from the new address (or new account), the next time you try to ask the remote computer to hold your mail for a vacation, or to unsubscribe, or whatever, you won't be able to get the robot to cooperate, 
because it won't believe it's really talking to you.

<BR>

<BR>So, even if your employer sets up a forwarding arrangement and you don't miss any of the incoming mail from your subscribed lists, you are still just waiting for problems, because the remote computer doesn't really know you changed accounts or host 
names.

<BR>

<BR>Unsubscribe and then, later, resubscribe from the &quot;new&quot; address. It will save you lots of trouble later.

<LI><I>Using the wrong subject heading for the topic you want to </I><I>discuss.</I> It's helpful and courteous to your readers if you fill in the subject line for every message. Readers who receive upwards of 50 messages a day come to necessarily rely on

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> Certainly change the subject line when you introduce an entirely new topic. But don't choose an entirely different subject heading when you are contributing to an ongoing topic or &quot;thread.&quot; It is much easier for 
everyone else reading the list to process, file, and relocate your idea by its association with the subject heading.

<LI><I>Addressing several topics in the same message.</I> Mixing two or more relatively unconnected ideas into a single, complex message.

<BR>

<BR><I>Evolved Response:</I> This is the reason for personal mail. Address the offender, but remember, we are all newbies in some sense, and the Net ethic is intended to encourage experimentation and learning. If you can't say something nice in your 
message, maybe you should just delete it and move on to something constructive?

<BR></P>

<P>As you become more and more skilled on the Net, your ability to surmount crises also increases. But most of the problems you run into are <I>still</I> human error. It's just a question of which human you end up blaming! The more you know, the more you 
know (what) you don't know, so to speak.

<BR></P>

<P>Most of the errors made by Internet gurus are the same things anybody could do, only on a grander scale. Anybody can mistype the word &quot;your&quot; as &quot;you,&quot; but it takes a real guru to send it out to 5 mailing lists so that 2750 people get 
<I>you</I> silly message!

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Patience, as they say, is a virtue. If a remote computer doesn't respond quickly, sometimes a novice too quickly assumes that the software has gone awry, and locked up the computer.

<BR></P>

<P>For gurus, usually, it's just that a bigger job than yours has come along, and has shoved you out of the spotlight for a while. Or, if this happens during daylight hours, the business (such as NASA, for instance) that owns the remote computer gives its 
own local workers much higher priority than remote users.

<BR></P>

<P>If you're lucky, the big job that displaced you will run itself out in a minute or two, and you will be back in business. If that two-minute wait is too much for you, or you've <I>already</I> waited five minutes to no avail, try some of the following 
tricks to get the attention of the remote machine, or bail out of a nonproductive trial.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>If you're a Windows user and you just know that the site you're about to visit <I>always</I> makes you wait a long time for a response, why not be ready to play a game of Cruel solitaire, that comes in the Windows 
Entertainment Pack (WEP)? Just open the game's window and minimize the dealt solitaire game, and it will be waiting when you get stuck in wait mode.

<P>Here are some things to try if you run into the Internet doldrums. Depending on your hardware and software, some of these tricks can force you to reboot your computer and/or reestablish your remote connection if they do <I>not</I> work&#151;so be sure 
to note the ones that do and don't work for your configuration, so you can choose wisely in the future. Software and hardware respond unpredictably to tricks designed for systems other than their own!

<P>Dr. Seuss, <I>The Cat in the Hat</I> (New York: Random House, 1957).

<BR></P>

<P><I>WAIS</I> is a distributed natural-language indexing, search, and retrieval tool. Right! Now what does that mumbo-jumbo mean?

<BR></P>

<P>It means you can use your regular vocabulary to search for things instead of fancy computer jargon. WAIS lets you ask simple questions in your own words and get lots of useful results from many computers and databases. That's better than the alternative 
of using special query languages to search one computer at a time, getting smaller results with less assurance of relevance and quality. The final result of a WAIS query is a set of document references (and full text in some cases) that contain the words 
you asked for.

<BR></P>

<P>WAIS enables you to search many databases all over the Internet. It searches the full-text of databases you select (called <I>sources</I> or <I>source </I><I>files</I>) by asking computers all over the Net to check their index files for words you're 
asking about. WAIS index files end with the extension .src, such as:

<BR></P>

<P>ANU-Demography-Publications.src</P>

<P>bryn-mawr-medival-reviw.src</P>

<P>directory-of-servers.src</P>

<P>document_centr_catalog.src</P>

<P>inet-libraries.src</P>

<P>jte.src

<BR></P>

<P>With some WAIS programs, you can also use Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT, or ADJ, for instance) to ask for combinations of words, so you can get closer and closer to exactly the items you want.

<BR></P>

<P>Public-domain clients for accessing WAIS are available for the following platforms: Macintosh, MS/DOS, Windows 3.x, VMS, NeXT, UNIX, and X Window. These clients are available via anonymous FTP from the University of North Carolina.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Searching Many Databases at One Time</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>You can search <I>many</I> databases at one time using the telnet site demonstrated later in this chapter. Unless you install a WAIS search program on your own personal computer, for serious searching gurus use a telnet WAIS search, because it's most 
efficient in using the Net's resources.

<BR></P>

<P>The user interface on the free telnet version of WAIS is real chunky, but you may learn to love this gnarled Internet tool.

<BR></P>

<P>The WAIS (pronounced like waist without the &quot;t&quot; at the end) output from this site is rough, and a little hard to understand. And you must always do a search <I>at least</I> twice, to get anything really useful. So why on earth would anyone 
want to use WAIS?

<BR></P>

<P>Because it's based on the <I>actual contents</I> of the files&#151;not file <I>names</I>, not directory <I>names</I>. Consequently, it won't be so likely to lead you to an empty directory. And as you get more sophisticated in constructing searches, you 
can eliminate wrong items and find only high quality &quot;hits.&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>Well, maybe that's overstating the case for WAIS a little. WAIS doesn't actually look inside files, really. It looks at sophisticated <I>indexes</I> of database files.

<BR></P>

<P>Astonishingly, the real contents of the target file, the one you're looking for, is <I>not</I> limited to words, so a WAIS index can lead you to graphic files, fonts, video and sound files, just about anything that can be put on a computer disk.

<BR></P>

<P>The key idea here is that indexes can refer to anything that can be described (which is a pretty big universe, to start with). Indexes can even refer to descriptions of odors and smells, can't they? Ever wonder if there was a database of fresh fruit or 
oven-baked pastry smells? Now that's an idea for a guru's meditation.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>WAIS Indexes</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Archie searches FTP sites worldwide; Jughead searches some Gopher menus; Veronica searches Gopher menus worldwide. They all do valuable searches, but none of them looks <I>inside</I> the index files to find content words, groups of words, and phrases 
the way WAIS does. The others look at menus and directory names, but only WAIS looks into the contents of the files, using indexes.

<BR></P>

<P>WAIS is associated with a standard method (ANSI Z39.50) for how to construct indexes for searching. So, WAIS is dependent on the quality and thoroughness of the indexes it is searching through. (The same limitation applies to Archie, and to the Whois 
system.)

<BR></P>

<P>There are over five hundred WAIS indexes (of databases) already built and available on the Net. The number is growing constantly. They cover educational topics of every variety, including:

<P>The separate databases are organized in different ways, using various database systems, but you don't have to learn the query languages of the various databases. WAIS uses your natural language queries to find relevant documents for you.

<BR></P>

<P>The technical experts say that no semantic information is extracted from WAIS queries. Part of what they mean is that WAIS indexes don't tell you if the search words are in any particular order or proximity. A WAIS index just tells you the words 
<I>are</I> in the document. Words that are of key importance to the indexed database, like those in document titles, words in all capitals, and words with initial capitals are given a little more weight in the index.

<BR></P>

<P>And there are also lots of stop words that just don't get indexed or searched for&#151;like the words <I>and</I>,<I> the</I>,<I> but</I>,<I> with</I>, and so on, because they are too common to mean anything important in an index or a search. But they 
are a vital part of <I>natural-language</I> searching, since they allow you to ask a questions like &quot;Please show me things about the space program?&quot; WAIS hears that question as &quot;space program&quot; or &quot;program space&quot; and just 
ignores all other natural language words.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Performing a WAIS Search</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>There are many WAIS servers throughout the Net. The main directory-of-servers database is available at several sites. Here is how you can address a query to it.

<BR></P>

<P>The host computer named quake.think.com is a demonstration site; anyone can telnet to it. At the login: prompt enter wais; no password is needed.

<BR></P>

<P>Although the client interface differs between platforms and versions of WAIS, each variant of the WAIS interface requires queries to be performed in the same way, whatever the interface:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI>The user selects a set of databases to be searched from among the available databases. This first stage of your search requires you to select extremely broad keywords, in order to select the WAIS databases relevant for your next, narrowed keyword 
search.

<BR>

<BR>If you're really seeking legal discussions of recent U.S. Supreme Court opinions, you would start your first WAIS search by asking &quot;tell me about law and government.&quot; This first search is to look through the database of databases, to find the 
right databases to use for the real search, which you'll do second.

<BR>

<BR>WAIS will return a list of databases that have &quot;law and government&quot; in them, and you can look at each database's brief description, if you are in doubt about it's relevance. Now you are ready to tell the WAIS program which databases to use in 
the next search - you're ready to select databases for your real search.

<BR>

<BR>Selecting the databases is slow and laborious. Each one requires you to highlight the database's line in the results of the first round of your search, and while the database name is highlighted you must type u for &quot;use this database in the next 
search.&quot;

<BR>

<BR>After highlighting and typing u for each database you select to search, you then must type s to go back to the source database selection screen, and again highlight each database to be used and this time, type an asterisk while the line is highlighted 
for each and every database you want the next search to be based on. Figure 14.2 shows an example of a WAIS &quot;source&quot; screen, with source databases available for searching shown.

<BR></P>

<P>Next, formulate a query by giving narrow, specific keywords to be searched for, like &quot;tell me about U.S. Supreme Court Opinions.&quot;</P>

<P>When the secondquery is run, WAIS asks for the keyword information from each selected database.</P>

<P>Headlines of documents satisfying the query are displayed. The selected documents contain the requested words and phrases. Selected documents are ranked according to the number of matches within them. Figure 14.3 shows you a sample of WAIS output,

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>To retrieve a document, the user simply selects it from the resulting list. Some documents are very short, and amount to only an index card entry. But others are research executive summaries, and lead you to highly relevant sources of further 
information.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>If the response is incomplete, the user can state the question differently or feed back to the system any one or more of the selected documents he finds relevant. Try your search again, with different keywords. You will lose all the work of your 
database selections when you type q to quit, so you should try the search at least twice while you are at it.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>When the search is run again, the results are updated to include documents that are similar to the ones selected, meaning documents that share a large number of common words.

<PRE>Surfing #02 UnCover: the biggest magazine rack you ever saw

When I was a boy, every town had a place like Mulligan's, a

neighborhood market filled with as much clutter as the proprietor

could cram in. The haven in the clutter was often a back wall

devoted to a vibrant collage of magazines screaming with info

about the latest craze. Always there was one to capture a new

interest and after a few passes through the table of contents, you

could tell if it was worth the hard earned coin.

Ever wish there was a place like Mulligan's on the Internet super

highway? A place where you could check the latest issue of your

favorite magazine or journal and decide whether it was worth

purchasing? Better yet, why not have this fictitious Mulligan's

mail you the Table of contents as soon as it hits the newsstand.

And what about all those pet projects, when you need to search

through a mountain of past issues. Wouldn't it be great if there

were a place on the Internet where you could search for articles

on any topic or by any author and then have those articles

forwarded to you.

Guess what! It's there, on the Internet super highway -- the

biggest magazine rack you have ever seen. It's called UnCover, and

includes more than 5,000 magazines and journals. The service is

vast, with an archive of well over 5,000,000 articles that can be

searched on and then FAXed to you within 24 hours. And yes, you

can even have the service e-mail you the table of contents of your

favorite monthly, soon off the press. And what about cost? Well

the searching is free and so is the Table of contents through e-

mail. It does cost, though, to have articles FAXed.

This issue of Surfing will be devoted to helping you explore the

services of UnCover.

Part I: Logging on to UnCover

At your Internet prompt type: Telnet database.carl.org

You will then be asked to select a terminal type from a list. For

most, the selection will be item (5) VT100. If you are unsure,

check with your computer folks. Once the terminal type is

selected, you will be at the opening screen for CARL.

CARL is an acronym for Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, a

not-for-profit organization formed in 1978 to create ways for

libraries to share information. One division of CARL services is

UnCover, an article delivery service. Until October of last year,

this service was available to only member libraries, but can now

be accessed free of charge by anyone with an Internet account.

Most of the services listed on the opening menu for CARL are

restricted to member libraries. You can explore items 1 (UnCover),

7 (Other Databases, which includes the Journal Graphic Database)

and 8 (CARL Systems Library Catalogs). These have public access.

For our purposes, we will be using UnCover. To enter the UnCover

services:

 Type: 1 at the &gt;&gt; prompt and press &lt;RETURN&gt;.

You will then encounter a series of four different prompts. For

now, keep pressing the &lt;RETURN&gt; key until you come to the screen

pictured below. These early prompts are for member libraries to

insert their password or for you as a single user to insert your

Profile Account number. A Profile Account is not necessary to use

the search functions of the service. Establishing a Profile

Account provides UnCover with some basic information about you --

name, e-mail address, etc. You will need a Profile Account if you

choose to have the Table of contents of various magazines

forwarded to you. (You might later want to re-enter UnCover and

establish a Profile Account for yourself.)

===========================================================

Congratulations! You are now logged on to the UnCover system. The

service is all menu driven -- typing the letter or number of a

menu item takes you to the next level of service. You should feel

comfortable exploring, there is little trouble that you can cause.

As is true with most Internet services, things slow down during

the middle of the day, so you might want to play around with

UnCover at a time when traffic on the net isn't as heavy.

Part II: Using NAME and WORD search

Both the Name and Word search features work similarly. If you are

looking for authors, you would use NAME search and if you are

looking for words in titles you would use the WORD search. WORD

search will only search for words in titles and in the brief

summaries that are contained on the Table of Content pages of

magazines; it will not search for words in the actual articles

themselves (too bad).

Here is an example to show how the features work.

 Type: W at the &gt;&gt; prompt

 Press &lt;RETURN&gt; (to enter WORD search)

At the next prompt, you can enter the words you are searching for.

You can enter one or several words depending on your criteria. For

our example:

 Type three words at the prompt: Liberal Arts Job

 Press &lt;RETURN&gt;

A list of four articles that meet our criteria will be displayed

(pictured below).

If your list is too long, you will be prompted to provide

additional words to help narrow your search. Looking over the

list, you will notice that item 2 includes our familiar &quot;Journal

of career planning and employment&quot;. This is pretty neat! UnCover

provides an index to our own professional journal.

You can now preview a summary of each article in the list. In this

example we will preview Laure Sharp's article (item 4 on the list)

 Type: 4 at the prompt and press &lt;RETURN&gt;

The information pictured below will appear on your screen listing

author, title, summary and location or source of the article. At

the bottom of the information you are given the cost to have the

article FAXed to you. This is as far as the service will take you;

you are not able to preview the actual article.

============= Article Summary ================

AUTHOR(s): Sharp, Laure M.

 Weidman, John C.

TITLE(s): Early Careers of Undergraduate Humanities Majors.

Summary: Data from the 1979 follow-up of the NLS-72 sample

 suggest that the early career experiences (two to

 three years post-baccalaureate) of undergraduate

 humanities majors differed little from their

 contemporaries who had majored in several other

 liberal arts fields, but contrasted with those in

 which job-major fit was better or pay higher.

===========================================================

For me, at this point, it's a trip to the local library. For one

thing my library may subscribe to the journal and I can get it for

free or they usually get a better rate to have the article FAXed -

- many libraries pay an annual subscription fee to the service.

Also, if you don't mind waiting for 6-10 days, you can probably

get the article free through inter library loan.

If you choose to have the article FAXed to you, you would enter M

at the prompt. A new item will be added to your command choices:

&lt;O&gt;rder. Once you have marked all the articles that you would like

FAXed, type O at the prompt. If you haven't established a Profile

Account you will be prompted for your name, FAX number and credit

card number. Then presto, the article will be at your FAX machine

within 24 hours.

Part III: Browsing by Journal Title

Another way you can use the service is to browse through the table

of contents of various magazines. This feature is accessed at the

Main Menu for UnCover. If you are in a different section of

UnCover, type Q and &lt;RETURN&gt; to trace your steps back to the Main

Menu. Once there:

 Type: B at the &gt;&gt; prompt

 Press &lt;RETURN&gt; (to enter Browse by Journal Title)

You will then be asked to type the name of the journal that you

wish to browse. For our example, type: Internet World

UnCover will then display a list of several journal titles.

Internet World should appear on top of the list.

 Type: 1 and &lt;RETURN&gt; to access the Internet World entry.

The information pictured below will appear on your screen listing

the name of the magazine, publisher and brief description.

============= Journal Summary ================

TITLE(s): Internet world.

is received, UnCover will automatically send the table of contents

to your e-mail address. For this to work, you will need to

establish a Profile Account. You can do that now:

 Type: //Profile at the prompt and &lt;RETURN&gt;

UnCover will bring you through the steps. You could also establish

a Profile Account when you first enter the program.

To continue with our example, use the E command to see a list of

issues that are on file with UnCover:

 Type: E at the prompt and &lt;RETURN&gt;

What you will see is the list pictured below.

As we did in the WORD search, you can now type the number of the

issue to bring up the table of contents for that issue. Once you

are in the table of contents, you can type the number for the

article to show a summary.

My apologies for being a bit long winded. There are other features

which I did not cover but you can learn about by using the help

screens that are built into the program.

 Type: ? and &lt;RETURN&gt; at any prompt for help or

<P>Many college and university courses and degree programs are already being offered on the Internet or have Net use as a vital course component. Some have brief, on-campus components as well, that require the student to be physically present at some 
particular location. Many offer videotaped classroom periods as one of the primary adjuncts to e-mail and telnet connections.

<BR></P>

<P>The samples of college and postgraduate programs below were chosen because they do not require <I>any</I> on-campus attendance, are open to the public, are not exclusively limited to students in a single state, company, or local broadcast area&#151;and 
e-mail is mentioned as a primary course component in their entry in <I>The Electronic University: A guide to </I><I>Distance Learning</I>, Peterson's Guides, c. 1993, Princeton, New Jersey.

<BR></P>

<P>Each entry in the Online Educational Resources section below has an e-mail address, telephone, fax, and surface mail address. Every student should carefully explore these opportunities before investing heavily in them. Make sure this method of learning 
meets your needs and fits your lifestyle <I>and your learning style</I> before you commit to a multi-year degree program!

<BR></P>

<P>The courses available <I>now</I> heavily emphasize continuing education and professional development for highly technical occupations&#151;Computer Science, all kinds of Engineering, and Telecommunications. But you will also find listed below programs 
in Management, Business, Education, Food Science, Human Services, Nursing, Social Work, and Library Science. Soon other professional schools will begin to make offerings on the Net, to position themselves in this new arena of the educational marketplace.

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>The diversity of instructional methods in these distance education offerings reflects the newness of this way of <I>doing the business of </I><I>education</I>. Education has been done face to face, students and teacher all in one physical place all at 
one time, for thousands of years. That's the whole concept of a school, isn't it? Well, today there are many new pedagogical technologies available, including

<BR></P>

<P>Fiber Optic Data, Communications, and Video</P>

<P>Internet BBS, Computer Conferencing, and E-mail</P>

<P>ITFS&#151;Instructional TV Fixed Service</P>

<P>Laserdisk</P>

<P>Microwave Transmission</P>

<P>Paper-based Correspondence</P>

<P>Satellite TV</P>

<P>Telephone, Fax</P>

<P>Video Conferencing and Compressed Video</P>

<P>Video and Audio Cassette</P>

<P>Video Broadcast, Public TV, Cable TV, Closed Circuit TV

<BR></P>

<P>Of course, most of the old limitations of time and space still apply to most of the preceding. And the options above also largely leave the &quot;teacher&quot; in control of events, rather than the learner/student being a self-reliant, adult, 
independent agent. Truly independent learning, guided by educators, may remain largely in the Internet's realm for some time to come.

<BR></P>

<P>Of the above technologies, those that are most under the learner's (time and space) control are:

<P>The way we see education is changing. Once, a person expected to go to school,<I> get an education</I>, and after graduating go to work in a single long career, and then retire. Now, we are realizing that many other combinations and permutations of 
education, career, and retirement are possible, and probably desirable.

<BR></P>

<P>Why must education be a one-time event, with a single rite of passage at the end of it? This &quot;tonsillectomy&quot; model of education (once it's done, it's <I>done</I>) is losing favor. A new model is gaining attention both in schools of education 
and in corporate circles: A nutritional or <I>gourmet</I> model of education&#151;learning is pleasant and necessary, and is best done regularly in prearranged and well designed cycles.

<BR></P>

<P>The online learning resources listed below presage the diminished importance of all central school campuses. Learning need not be at a single location&#151;the Net is everywhere. The Net can be a tremendous boon to isolated rural schools. This is 
because if rural areas actually receive their promised equal access to the Net, they will be able to supply a much higher quality of education without the immediate physical presence of all the amenities, resources, and dangers of urban schools.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="note.gif"><B>Note: </B>Many states, provinces, and localities have excellent programs for their state or region. But programs are listed here only if they offer open admission to qualified members of the public <I>nationwide</I>.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>But many excellent programs are geographically limited, primarily by the hardware they use. For instance, broadcast TV and cable TV are limited to locations within their signal and cabled service areas, and ITFS (Instructional TV Fixed Service) is 
limited to a broadcasting radius of around 20 miles.

<BR></P>

<P>Therefore, in addition to the nationwide resources listed below, to find Internet-related distance learning opportunities in your local area, check with your local library or bookstore. Or you may want to consult the book <I>The Electronic University: A 
Guide to Distance Learning</I>, by Peterson's Guides, Princeton, New Jersey, which contains dozens of state, local, and regional educational programs with Internet components.

<BR></P>

<P>Here are 18 education programs across North America that include an Internet component.

<P>Here are just a couple of samples to show you that elementary, middle schools, and high schools are already using the Internet. Although Gopher is probably a more practical and inexpensive program for a school to operate, these examples focus on World 
Wide Web (WWW) home pages, simply because they are more graphic and <I>visually</I> interesting. Transferring graphics, and sound files, can be extremely slow and taxes the Net's bandwidth, so that some feel WWW may weaken the Internet rather than show off 
its best possibilities.

<P>Probably the simplest search command is

<BR></P>

<PRE>search * in listname</PRE>

<P>which would result in the selection of all the messages in the archives of the list listname.

<P>This search can be modified to include only messages sent after a given date, before a given date, or between two dates.

<BR></P>

<PRE>search * in listname since 92/01/01

search * in listname before 92/01/01

search * in listname from 92/01/01 to 92/06/30</PRE>

<P>The above messages will select all messages sent to the list, since January 1, 1992; before that date; and for the first 6 months of 1992.

<BR></P>

<P>Specific words can be searched, also. For example, the following search seeks two words, facilitated and communication.

<BR></P>

<PRE>search facilitated communication in listname</PRE>

<P>This search will identify a list of all messages containing the words facilitated and communication.

<BR></P>

<P>The search rules can be modified to send messages that contained words that appeared, for example, since the beginning of 1993.

<BR></P>

<PRE>search facilitated communication in listname since 93/01/01</PRE>

<P>It is also possible to select messages on the basis of the sender of the message. The following command returns a list of all the messages sent by Dave Kinnaman.

<BR></P>

<PRE>search * in listname where sender is kinnaman@world.std.com</PRE>

<P>In combination with a date command, only messages from Dave Kinnaman for the last half of 1992 will be returned by the following request.

<BR></P>

<PRE>search * in listname where sender is kinnaman@world.std.com from

-92/07/01 to 92/12/31</PRE>

<P>(Please note that the - character is used to indicate a continuation of the command on the next line.)

<BR></P>

<P>It is also possible to do <I>phonetic</I> searches:

<BR></P>

<PRE>search * in listname where sender sounds like cinnamon</PRE>

<P>The full complement of Boolean keywords (AND, OR, NOT, CONTAINS, and so on) are available in the Listserv database functions. The <I>Listdb Memo</I> provides complete documentation, with examples.

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>A new Windows-compatible program called InfoMagnet is so powerful it not only maintains your Listserv subscriptions for you, it also searches Listserv archives for you. It uses the same procedures just described, but automates them so they are almost 
invisible to the user! See Figure 19.9.

<BR></P>

<P>The version demonstrated here is clearly a beta version, but it is quite impressive already. Figure 14.10 shows the New Discussion Group List selection screen, which enables you to choose from about two dozen major topic areas for further investigation. 
For all the remaining figures in this chapter, you should imagine we selected &quot;Education&quot; at this choice point.

<P>As you can see, the Listserv discussion topic areas that InfoMagnet can show you include Apple Computers, Art, Biology and Chemistry, Business, Computers, Databases, Ecology, Education, Food, Graphics, History, IBM, and many more major areas.

<BR></P>

<P>Figure 19.11 shows you just the top of an alphabetical list of about 180 education-related listings already in this beta version of InfoMagnet.

<P>Over 700 people currently subscribe to EDPOLYAN - the Education Policy Analysis Forum. Would you like to listen in? Or perhaps you'd prefer to participate actively? Figure 19.12 shows the details about this discussion list.

<BR></P>

<P>When you double-click a line in the Education list selection screen, the first detail screen, which InfoMagnet calls a &quot;Peek,&quot; is shown for whichever list you clicked on.

<BR></P>

<P>As you can see from the InfoMagnet Peek at the list EDPOLYAN screen, a lot of information is provided on each of the Listserv discussion lists covered in InfoMagnet. Besides Peeking at each list, in the upper left of the screen, you'll see that you can 
initiate a search of the list's archives, or have InfoMagnet send the messages for you to join the list. Also available on this screen are several details about the list: Whether the list has archives or not, whether it is a public or a private 
&quot;moderated&quot; list, an estimate of the number of subscribers, the list's physical location, and a complete set of the Internet addresses needed to manage all business with this list is provided on the InfoMagnet Peek screen!

<BR></P>

<P>InfoMagnet really does handle everything for you. Figure 19.13 shows the settings you choose as defaults for how you want to subscribe to Listservs. Every choice that is normally available to you is handled by the program&#151;automatically! These 
choices include: Whether to subscribe as a full member, digest member, index member, or to subscribe but not receive any mail; whether to conceal your name from the &quot;review&quot; command; and how you want acknowledgment of your own posts to the list 
handled.

<BR></FONT></A></H5>

<P>Here is an excellent <I>free</I> news filtering service. It was designed with funding from the Pentagon, so you know it has some serious horsepower behind it. It is being upgraded regularly, so you can expect this already fine service to continue to 
improve.

<BR></P>

<P>The brief instruction manual is included next, because you may need these details to manage your news filtering subscriptions. This is such a valuable service, you should have the complete instructions right from the beginning!

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>This filtering service <I>does not</I> use Boolean searching. It doesn't know what the words AND, OR, and NOT mean.

<BR>

<BR>It also does not know that employer, employee, employment, and employ are related words. So your search <I>should</I> use all the variations on the same root word. Use them all and you will get more &quot;hits.&quot;

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>Here's a quick example of how it works. For each filter topic you define, you send a list of words to the service&#151;each list of words is a new subscription. This example would ask the service to search hundreds of newsgroups for messages that 
contain the words education rural funding schools teacher.

<BR></P>

<P>Subscription:

<BR></P>

<P>e-mail: netnews@db.stanford.edu</P>

<P>body: subscribe education rural funding schools teacher

<BR></P>

<P>The service will acknowledge your subscription and begin sending you by e-mail each evening the first 20 lines of any &quot;hits&quot; it finds. Hits are messages the service finds that have most of your search words in them. If the first twenty lines 
of a hit look good to you, you should ask the service to send you the whole message.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>This service does not save messages for very long, so ask for any &quot;hits&quot; you really want within 48 hours of being notified of the message by the Netnews Filtering Service.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>There are several more detailed options described in the following instruction manual. Again, this service is <I>free</I>, so what have you got to lose? Make up a search and let Stanford do the fishing for you!

 The Database Group at Stanford is providing a filtering service for NetNews

 articles. A user sends his profiles to the service, and will receive news

 articles relevant to his interests periodically. Communication to and from

 the service is via e-mail messages.

 A user's profile is, in the style of WAIS [1] queries, just a plain piece of

 English text; e.g., &quot;object oriented programming,&quot; or &quot;nba golden state

 warriors basketball.&quot; Based on the statistical distributions of the words in

 the articles, scores are given to evaluate how relevant they are to a

 profile. The highest possible score given to an article document is 100. The

 user can specify the minimum score for an article to be delivered.

 Below we first look at a sample message from the user and a sample notifica-

 tion from the service. Then we describe details of the user message format.

 The user can then request the whole article sent to him if he thinks it is

 ( C )  U S E R  M E S S A G E  F O R M A T

 User messages should be sent to netnews@db.stanford.edu. The subject field of

 the message is ignored. Each message is a request to the service. Each

 request consists of a number of commands. Each command must start with a new

 line with no leading spaces. Continuation lines begin with a space or a tab.

 All commands are case-insensitive.

 Requests are associated with the return address of the user message. Service

 replies and deliveries will be sent to that address.

 The usages of the commands are as follows.

 ( C . 1 )  S u b s c r i b i n g

 To subscribe for articles, use these commands:

 SUBSCRIBE word word ...       Subscribe for articles relevant to the profile

                                specified by &lt;word&gt;'s. Maybe followed by

                                PERIOD, EXPIRE, and THRESHOLD commands.

 PERIOD period                  (Optional - default 1 days) Specify &lt;period&gt;

                                as the period between notifications (in days).

 EXPIRE days                    (Optional - default 9999 days) Specify

                                &lt;days&gt; as the length (in days) for which

                                the subscription is valid.

 THRESHOLD score                (Optional - default 60) Specify &lt;score&gt; as the

                                minimum score for an article to be relevant.

                                The most relevant article is given a score of

                                100. &lt;score&gt; must an integer between 1 to 100.

 For example, to subscribe for articles related to &quot;information filtering,&quot;

 valid for 200 days, send this:

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 % mail netnews@db.stanford.edu

 Subject:

 subscribe information filtering

 expire 200

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 The service will acknowledge your subscription, returning a subscription

 identifier (sid).

 ( C . 2 )  G e t t i n g  A r t i c l e s

 After receiving notifications of articles that may be relevant to your

 interests, you may decide to see an article in its entirety. You can get the

 whole article with the GET command:

 GET article article ...       Get the articles specified (by their article

                                ids).

 For example,

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 % mail netnews@db.stanford.edu

 Subject:

 get news.announce.conferences.3670

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 ( C . 3 )  R e l e v a n c e  F e e d b a c k

 After reading the articles, you may find some that you like. You can provide

 feedback using these commands:

 FEEDBACK sid                   Provide feedback to subscription &lt;sid&gt;.

 LIKE article article ...      Specify relevant article(s) by their ids.

 For example, this message says that article news.announce.conferences.3670 is

 relevant to subscription 1:

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 % mail netnews@db.stanford.edu

 Subject:

 feedback 1

 like news.announce.conferences.3670

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 With feedback information, the service may be able to better match future

 articles against your subscriptions.

 ( C . 4 )  M a n a g i n g  S u b s c r i p t i o n s

 You can manage your subscriptions with these commands:

 UPDATE sid                     Update subscription with id &lt;sid&gt;. Must be

                                followed by one or more of PERIOD, EXPIRE,

                                THRESHOLD (see C.1.), or PROFILE commands to

                                specify the parameter(s) to be updated.

 PROFILE word word ...         Specify the new profile for the UPDATE command.

 CANCEL sid                     Cancel subscription &lt;sid&gt;.

 LIST                          List all your subscriptions.

 For example, to update the period and the threshold of a subscription:

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 % mail netnews@db.stanford.edu

 Subject:

 update 3

 period 1

 threshold 60

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 ( C . 5 )  S e a r c h  F o r  P a s t  A r t i c l e s

 Besides providing the subscription service, the service also allows you to

 search for recent articles that are already in the database:

 SEARCH word word ...          Do a search of the database with the given

                                query. Maybe optionally followed by a THRESHOLD

                                command to specify the minimum score for an

                                article to be retrieved.

 For example, to search for articles related to &quot;information filtering&quot;:

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 % mail netnews@db.stanford.edu

 Subject:

 search information filtering

 END                            End the request message. Useful for

<P>As we near the close of this chapter, we will first provide a starting point for the youngest Net users, and then review several ways of organizing the many uses schools are now making of the Net. Finally, a few glimpses of the Net's educational

<FONT SIZE=3><B>When Should the Internet Enter the Classroom?</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>As usual, this depends on your own comfort level, and on the equipment and support available. Watching adults learn is very helpful for kids, so you shouldn't necessarily wait until you're a guru to start using the Net in school. It is very comforting 
for some children to see an adult being thwarted by this new keyboard-thing in the same way that they are.

<BR></P>

<P>The least expensive alternative starting place is e-mail. Color is not required on the computer monitor screen, and practically all Internet service providers have some kind of e-mail. And <I>even the youngest </I><I>children</I>, preschoolers and 
kindergartners, can learn lots of things from e-mail:

<BR></P>

<UL>

<LI><I>Geography.</I> Mapping the locations of e-mail friends.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI><I>Language Arts.</I> What words do people use to describe themselves? How are formal and informal speech different? What happens if the keys aren't pressed in the &quot;right&quot; order?

<P>As the target audiences grow older, and more sophisticated, the whole Net opens to their keyboards. Teachers around the world are using this new communication medium to nurture learning in every conceivable curriculum area.

<P>How these combinations and permutations manifest with various Internet tools is fascinating to behold. Next are three ways to organize the educational uses of the Internet.

<BR></P>

<P>This first classification method groups Net tools with different combinations of students, teachers, and behavioral curriculum goals:

<P>Students' and teachers' access to scientific expertise</P>

<P>Students' and teachers' access to information (libraries, and so on)</P>

<P>Students' and teachers' access to computers and software</P>

<P>Collaborative development and delivery of instruction and materials</P>

<P>Teacher education and enhancement</P>

<P>Electronic publishing of students' products

<BR></P>

<P>Next is a second practical method of organizing the options, from a different perspective.

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>If you need some quick ideas on what to do in class, or some sources of lesson plans on the Net, get the new book <B><I>Education and the Internet</I></B>, by Dr. Jill Ellsworth, and look in Chapter 2, &quot;Internet 
Resources by Curricular Area.&quot; Choose a topic area you or your kids would be interested in, and several resources will be at your fingertips!

<FONT SIZE=3><B>The Internet's Educational Potential</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>For decades there have been outcries and reform movements about the quality of &quot;free&quot; public education in the U.S. But the problems of classroom educators have <I>not</I> been solved, even though dozens of popular attempts have been made to 
reform public education.

<BR></P>

<P>Universal access to the Internet could provide the final panacea for education, <B><I>if</I></B> it is truly universal, affordable, and if Internet training and technical support are easily available to all.

<BR></P>

<P>In August 1992, then United States Senator Al Gore said &quot;In the past few years, we have witnessed the democratization of the Internet. Today, the network connects not only to the top research laboratories and universities but also small colleges, 
small businesses, libraries, and high schools throughout the country.&quot;&#151;quoted by Tracy LaQuey in <I>The </I><I>Internet Companion</I> (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1992, p. vi).

<BR></P>

<P>As we have already seen, <I>elementary</I> and <I>middle schools</I> have also now joined the writhing throng on the Net. Why are educators at <I>all grade </I><I>levels</I> so hopeful about the Internet?

<BR></P>

<P>It may be that a paradigm shift is occurring in the way our society deals with information and learning. With limitations of time and space swept away by open, affordable access to the Internet, anybody can learn whatever they want, wherever they want 
to learn it, at any time of day. Telephone companies installed over 2,300,000 miles of fiber optic cable in 1993 in order to prepare for their role in delivery of Internet quality services throughout the U.S. These cables can change our schools and our 
lives.

<BR></P>

<P>U.S. hospitals have seen many of their services rapidly shift in the past few years to out-patient clinics. So also we may soon see colleges, high schools, and middle schools being less important as the sites of education. Is there a fundamental reason 
why all learning must occur with several students and a single teacher in a particular room all at the same time? Gurus say no, there is not.

<BR></P>

<P>There is also no reason why all students must experience the exact same presentations of new ideas, or the exact same drills and practice. Why not have advanced software to keep track of each student's learning style and adjust the pace, sequence, and 
level of detail for that one precious student?

<BR></P>

<P>This use of computers would usurp some of the teacher's role in the current educational system. What's left for the teacher to do?

<BR></P>

<P>Teachers will find that their role does change dramatically with increased use of the Internet for learning. The best teachers will be those who are <I>themselves</I> good at learning and at guiding others to the right next bit of learning. Teachers, 
too, will need to be more concerned with individual learning styles, and much less concerned about classroom control. They will need to concentrate much more heavily on asking the right questions, rather than being the <I>source</I> of the right answers!

<BR></P>

<P>Students quickly discern which teachers are aware of and involved with the new technology. Teachers who do not adopt the new may become increasingly obsolete and unpopular. Librarians, on the other hand, are likely to rise in power and respect simply 
because of their advanced skills at information processing, search, and retrieval. Because many perceptive librarians have embraced the Internet and are already revered among its greatest gurus, their profession will likely return to, and perhaps exceed, 
its former esteemed grandeur.

<BR></P>

<P>This may be the last, best opportunity this century to really accomplish a major step forward for broad public education. If the National Information Infrastructure (NII) fulfills its promise during our lifetimes, <I>every</I> literate person can have 
lifelong learning and ongoing personal development as a matter of policy, not as a <I>one-time</I> dose of education or training.

<BR></P>

<P>Because the Internet frees us from the bonds of time and space, we can all use educational materials at the Ivy League schools, or at the top research laboratories, without even &quot;graduating&quot; from a high school, much less passing the entrance 
requirements and paying the fees of an Ivy League college.

<BR></P>

<P>Knowledge, experience, and personal skills may become more important in the workplace than credentials like graduations and advanced degrees. Access to advanced technical information can be at the fingertip control of every individual human seeking 
knowledge, rather than being controlled by a &quot;sage on the stage,&quot; which characterizes the old educational regime.

<BR></P>

<P>Now we close this chapter with three short quotes from a great leader and philosopher, the third President of the United States. The framers of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) would do well to listen carefully and heed his wise counsel.

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;By far the most important bill in our whole code, is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness. If anybody thinks that kings, nobles, priests are 
good conservators of the public happiness, send [that person to Europe.]&quot;

<P>&quot;I know of no safe depository of the ultimate power of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform 
their discretion by education.&quot;
