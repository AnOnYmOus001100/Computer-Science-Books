<P>The fax machine, like electronic mail, has helped revolutionize how we work. Businesses large and small send and receive faxes (short for facsimiles) any time a copy of a document is needed quickly on the other side of town, or the other side of the 
planet. Faxing has some advantages over electronic mail&#151;you can easily send images and, more notably, your recipient doesn't need to be wired to the Internet to receive a fax. A phone line and an inexpensive machine or fax modem is all it takes.

<BR></P>

<P>Fax machines are devices that can send a copy of a printed page over a telephone line to another fax machine. Standard faxes work by &quot;scanning&quot; the page to transmit for light and dark areas. The machine converts the tonal values to sounds and 
sends them over a phone line to a recipient machine that converts the sounds back into light and dark tones and prints them on paper.

<BR></P>

<P>Although fax machines have been in popular use since the 1970s, the technology for turning the printed page into sound was invented hundreds of years ago. Not until the invention of the telephone and the proliferation of computers and microchips, did 
fax machines become a practical method of information exchange.

<BR></P>

<P>Here's the best part: because you're on the Internet, you don't even need a fax machine to send faxes. That's right&#151;you can send a fax without using a fax machine or one of those fancy New-Age fax modems. There are several services for sending a 
fax via electronic mail. So, if you need to send a note to a friend or an associate who's not online, you can do so without logging out of your Net account.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="note.gif"><B>Note: </B>Although you may think fax machines are just a staple for big business, small offices and home-based businesses have also discovered their usefulness. If the current trend continues, by 1995, 30 percent of all U.S. homes 
will have a fax machine.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>Some of these services are free, run as experiments or by hobbyists. Others are commercial services that charge a fee for every fax you send. As you might expect, the quality and coverage of these services can vary considerably. The free services all 
have limited coverage areas: most span only a city or a few area codes. The commercial services often cover wider areas, but are (of necessity) more expensive.

<BR></P>

<P>So, how do you send a fax via e-mail? Read on. The following information discusses eight services that will let you do just that. And, since this is e-mail, you can send your fax to multiple destinations, or even a combination of fax machines and 
regular e-mail recipients. Be sure to notice that the procedure is not standardized because each service operates a little differently from the rest.

<BR></P>

<P>All of these services let you send plain old ASCII text. Some of them can even handle PostScript documents, should you want to send a fax with fancy formatting or graphics. But unlike a &quot;real&quot; fax machine, all of these services can only send 
information that is stored in your computer: that hand-written letter from Aunt Zelda and your kid's finger-paint artwork just can't be sent in this manner (unless, of course, you scan it in to your computer and convert the graphic to a PostScript 
document&#151;I don't even want to <I>think</I> about that.). If you just want to send unformatted documents created with your word processor, you've got it easy.

<P>You may find that the following e-mail-to-fax services are a little funky, sometimes unreliable, or downright unusable. But the upside is, they're free! (To be honest, you'll probably find that they all work pretty well, but I do hear the occasional 
complaint about unreliable services. I just thought I'd warn you.)

<FONT SIZE=3><B>TPC.INT Remote Printing</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>The most (in)famous fax-from-the-Internet service is the brainchild of Carl Malamud (the creator of Internet Talk Radio) and Marshall Rose. They're doing research on how to integrate special-purpose devices, like facsimile printers, into the fabric of 
the Internet.

<BR></P>

<P>The official name for this project is &quot;an experiment in remote printing&quot;, or TPC.INT. The experiment is a good hack, enabling Internet users to easily send faxes via electronic mail. It works simply enough&#151;send electronic mail to a 
special address, and soon after (if your recipient's fax machine is in a covered area) out comes a freshly-minted fax. After the deed is done, you will receive electronic mail telling you if your fax was successfully sent or not.

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="note.gif"><B>Note: </B>What does TPC stand for? Go rent the film <I>The </I><I>President's Analyst</I>, Paramount Pictures, 1967.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>A variety of companies, institutions and citizens linked to the Internet have joined the experiment by linking a computer and fax modem to the Net. When an organization joins the remote-fax service, it specifies which areas it is willing to send faxes 
to. In most cases, an organization will allow faxes to be sent to any machine that is a local call from its fax server.

<BR></P>

<P>As a result, with just a smattering of organizations participating, you can't send a fax just anywhere. When you send an e-mail fax message, you (naturally) must include the phone number of the recipient's fax machine. The TPC.INT server looks at the 
phone number and decides if any participating fax machines cover the area to which you want to send a fax. If so, your message is routed to the appropriate machine for &quot;faxation.&quot; Otherwise, you will receive electronic mail with the disappointing 
news that your fax couldn't be delivered.

<BR></P>

<P>Although the service is free, the service's creators are investigating ways to help the organizations recover the cost of sending faxes. So far, this has been primarily through little advertisements&#151;sponsorship messages touting the good name of the 
organization operating the fax node&#151;on the title page of the resulting fax.

<BR></P>

<P>To send a fax by e-mail, send this message:

<BR></P>

<PRE>To: remote-printer.<I>info</I>@<I>phone_number</I>.iddd.tpc.int</PRE>

<P>where <I>info</I> contains information for the cover page. In <I>info</I>, / is turned into a line break and _ is turned into a space. For example, the address:

<BR></P>

<PRE>To: remote-printer.Arlo_Cats/Room_123@12025551212.iddd.tpc.int</PRE>

<P>Would send a fax to +1-202-555-1212 with the cover page:

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="note.gif"><B>Note: </B>There's another way to address faxes which works more reliably sometimes. In this format, the phone number is backwards and the numbers are separated by periods. It looks ugly, but it works:
