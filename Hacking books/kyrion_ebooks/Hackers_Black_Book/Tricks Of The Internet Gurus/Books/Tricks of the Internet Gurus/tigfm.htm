<P><B>Yesterday I was talking to my dog, Spot.</B>

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;Hey, Spot,&quot; I said, &quot;with the massive amount of cash this Foreword has brought me, I felt generous, and so I bought you your very own computer.&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>Spot looked across the room to where I'd set up the machine next to his water dish. Still shiny with that putty-gray factory finish, it was the very latest model&#151;the IBM Dog Computer 3000 with a cordless pawboard and a squeaky mouse! A 999,000-baud 
modem was connected to Spot's very own phone line. &quot;Gosh,&quot; drooled Spot, &quot;Thank you, Kibo! It's the most wonderful thing anyone ever gave a dog like me! Now I can log on to that amazing new Information Superhighway!&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;Uh, Spot, before you do, you know how to use the Internet, right?&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>Spot barked happily and ran in a little circle. &quot;Sure I do! I've seen <I>The Lawnmower Man</I> and <I>WarGames</I> and every episode of William Shatner's awesome <I>Tekwar</I>. I know all about this stuff. First you put on your virtual reality 
helmet and your glowing blue neon datasuit, then you fly through the maze, and laser beams come out of your eyes and you have to shoot the computer viruses before they turn you into a skeleton and then you have twenty seconds to guess the three-letter 
password before all the nuclear missiles in the world come out of the screen at you!!!&quot; Spot turned on his new computer and the screen lit up:

<BR></P>

<PRE>&gt;</PRE>

<P>Spot cried. &quot;Waah! This sucks! Kibo, you tricked me. I hate you!&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;Now, now, little Spot, it wasn't I who cruelly deceived you. It was the <I>media</I>. Remember, everything can be blamed on the media. Who told you it was called 'The Information Superhighway'?&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;The media,&quot; sobbed Spot.

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;And who told you it was a super-cool new thing they just invented last week?&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;The media,&quot; sobbed Spot.

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;And who told you it was a dangerous and scary thing that could molest your children while they sleep?&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>&quot;The media!&quot; bawled Spot. &quot;Oh, how I hate them! They're evil. I guess I don't know anything about what the so-called Information Superhighway is really like. Kibo, you'll have to show me what to do here.&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>I leaned over and typed in Spot's password, DOG$BONE. Spot was now logged in to the world's most powerful information service, Dogidy.

<BR></P>

free supply of your favorite brand of dog food.</PRE>

<P>Spot burst into tears again. &quot;Waah! I can't <I>read</I>, I'm just a <I>dog</I>!&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>The &quot;Information Superhighway,&quot; for some reason, has become the hot new topic. <I>Every</I> magazine has done at least one article on it, usually emphasizing its hip trendiness.

<BR></P>

<P>The Internet has been around for decades in various forms. Heck, you could even trace its precursors back to the laying of the first transcontinental phone cable. Early computer networking often involved computers making phone calls to each other. Then, 
someone came up with the bright idea of connecting special lines directly between the computers so that they could communicate faster, and without paying the phone company. Various computers were connected to different networks, such as ARPAnet, Bitnet, 
and so on. Eventually these networks were linked together in various ways, so that now, effectively, all the well-connected computers in the world are on one network&#151;the Internet. The computers communicate with one another in various ways&#151;via 
cables, via microwave dishes, via satellite, and yes, some still call each other on the phone.

<BR></P>

<P>The commercial &quot;information services&quot; are now getting in on the game as well&#151;if you have a CompuServe account, you can send mail to someone who has an America Online account, through the magic of the Internet. Businesses are offering 
electronic catalogs of their goods over the network, so that you can shop with your computer. You can send letters to people ranging from Conan O'Brien to the President over the network, without having to pay for a stamp. (Whether you pay for the network 
is different, but there certainly are ways of getting on for free.) You can browse through massive libraries of information, and even download entire books within minutes.

<BR></P>

<P>Ten years ago, you could have done many of the same things. You couldn't have sent electronic mail to President Clinton (or even President Reagan), and CompuServe users were forced to chat only with other CompuServe users, but the basic capabilities for 
dealing with large quantities of information rapidly were there. So why is there this sudden craze for the &quot;Information Superhighway?&quot;

<BR></P>

<P>Is it because someone coined that damned term?

<BR></P>

<P>Is it because computers are slowly getting easier to use?

<BR></P>

<P>Because they're rapidly getting more powerful?

<BR></P>

<P>Or is it just a &quot;hundredth-monkey&quot; situation, where enough people have gotten &quot;into&quot; it so that it's now chic?

<BR></P>

<P>I don't know, but the number of people connected to the Internet, and the quality of their connections, and the quantity of information moving over the network, continues to increase. I've had access for only eight years, but in that time, I've seen an 
amazing increase in the amount of <I>stuff</I> that happens on the network. For instance, on my favorite Internet service, Usenet, I can recall when I could read most all the articles in one day. Today, there are over 9600 <I>topics</I> on Usenet (it'll be 
ten thousand by the time the book is printed!), and many of them contain enough articles to keep you busy for several hours.

<BR></P>

<P>As the network grows and grows, the users (and their interfaces) need to grow more sophisticated just to be able to keep up with the flood of information. To be a &quot;power user&quot; these days, you need finely-honed skills that let you find the 
information or service or discussion you want, without having to wade through ten zillion irrelevant things. Just <I>finding</I> the documentation on how to do something (let alone <I>reading</I> possibly hundreds of pages of it) can be a difficult task.

<BR></P>

<P>Speaking of reading hundreds of pages, Spot finally managed to teach himself to read by following the self-guided tutorial in GNU EMACS. In just fifty easy lessons, Spot could read like a pro! With newfound enthusiasm, he logged into Dogidy and read the 
first screenful of text.

<BR></P>

<P>Spot was so excited by the availability of billions of bytes of information that he instantly forgot how to read. Poor Spot!

<P>The <I>Internet guru</I> is a hard person to define. No test exists to qualify a person as an Internet guru. It is not always obvious who is and is not a guru. Often, I am talking to some novices and they mention that someone is an &quot;Internet 
guru.&quot; When I meet this person, it is frequently the case that the supposed guru is giving out wrong and misleading information. Therefore, the first criteria of being an Internet guru is that other Internet gurus must be able to respect the accuracy 
your Internet knowledge.

<BR></P>

<P>If you watch Internet gurus in action, they usually show extremely strong feelings about the Internet. Almost all, if not all, find the Internet to be an exciting and fun place. This interest is critical to any Internet guru; the Internet is so large 
and changing so fast that without a strong passion, a guru will become a nonguru within a couple of years.

<BR></P>

<P>An Internet guru knows that the Internet only works due to information sharing that is mostly for free. The guru, therefore, must give something back to the Internet to improve the network. It might be a piece of software, documentation, frequently 
answering posts on Usenet constructively, or even just having a useful Gopher or Web server.

<BR></P>

<P>The guru knows that he or she does not and cannot know everything about the Internet. Therefore, this books offers a great deal, even to the guru. For example, while I was reading this book, I learned quite a bit about a subject that I knew nothing 
about, like programming muds. The guru, though, has many tools <I>and</I> an ability to learn that compensates for gaps in knowledge. Related to this, the Internet guru has contacts and/or friendships with other gurus that provide invaluable information.

<BR></P>

<P>Every guru is different in knowledge, background, career, and personality. This is important to remember. Some are not even computer professionals and instead are librarians, scientists, artists, musicians, or students. Basically, they can be from any 
place and any walk of life. For a brief sampling of Internet gurus, consider a few of the authors who wrote parts of this book. In many ways, I may be one of the most typical of Internet gurus. I am very strong in end-user Internet services (WWW, Gopher, 
OPACs, FTP sites, and so on) and can even manage routers, but I know very little about network management or muds. Another author, Kevin Mullet, is one of the people who holds Internet connectivity together within Texas&#151;he knows network management 
inside and out (among other aspects of the Internet). Kenny Greenberg is also an Internet guru, even though he is first and foremost an artist. The other authors all come from different backgrounds.

<BR></P>

<P>Now that you may have a vague idea of what an Internet guru is, you may want to become one yourself. Fortunately, it is much easier to define the steps in becoming a guru than defining what a guru is. The steps I recommend:

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>Become a proficient Internet user. Many books and training sessions are available to help you get to this state.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Learn about the society and politics of the Internet. Books, such as <I>The Internet Unleashed</I> (Indianapolis: Sams Publishing, 1994), will help with this. However, nothing substitutes for some time spent on mailing lists and Usenet news.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Decide which parts of the Internet excite you. Concentrate on learning these. As I said earlier, nobody knows everything about the Internet.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Do some background reading. This book will definitely help you here, but reading some network documents such as RFCs is also important.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Try out what you have learned&#151;as long as it is legal and ethical. No Internet guru evolves without spending a lot of hands-on time on the network itself.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>When your experiments fail (and they sometimes will), either go back to Step 4 or ask on mailing lists or newsgroups, and then try again. The urge to give up may be strong at times, but don't give in!

<BR>

<BR></LI></OL>

<P><I>Good luck</I> on becoming an Internet guru. Also, make sure you <I>have fun</I> while reading <I>Tricks of the Internet Gurus</I>, or you have been missing the point.
