<P>This chapter attempts to explain some tips and tricks for the telnet command. It does not attempt to cover all telnet programs on all platforms; that would be too onerous a task. Instead, it concentrates on NCSA Telnet, which runs on MS-DOS machines 
with network connections; QVTNET, which runs under Windows in a networked environment; and UNIX Telnet, with which most Internet users will be familiar. In all of these versions, telnet enables a user to connect to another Internet machine, whether it be 
in the next room or halfway around the globe. The phrase <I>Internet machine</I> refers to a system that is running the TCP/IP protocols. These protocols are what make Internet connectivity possible. Telnet is often referred to as <I>remote login</I>, 
which simply means connecting one machine to another so that a user may interact with that other machine as though he or she were actually using it locally.

<BR></P>

<P>To explain this concept simply, take a look at a typical telnet session using the UNIX version.

<P>In most cases it is not neccessary to use or even understand all of the commands. Let us, instead, concentrate on those that are useful and often deployed. By issuing the command:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>open willow.usask.ca</B></PRE>

<P>and pressing Enter, the user connects to a machine named willow, which is situated at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>open willow.usask.ca</B>

login:</PRE>

<P>The local system tried to connect to the remote system willow.usask.ca, which also has the Internet number 128.233.74.5. In this case, the user is being told that the keyboard characters Ctrl+] will break the connection, that willow is operating with 
UNIX(r) System V Release 4.0, and that it is ready to accept a user login name. If the user has an account on the remote system, then the username is entered:

<BR></P>

<PRE>login: <B>scott</B></PRE>

<P>This brings up the password prompt, enabling the user to complete the login:

<BR></P>

<PRE>password: <B>xxxxxxxx</B></PRE>

<P>and receive the remote prompt:

<BR></P>

<PRE>willow&gt;</PRE>

<P>When the user has finished using the remote system, he or she may want to return to the local system. A simple logout or exit command usually suffices.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Using the Esc Character</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Sometimes, it is not obvious which command is valid for logging out of a remote machine. A user may key any number of terms to break the connection and still not succeed. The best way to break a connection is with the escape character&#151;in this 
example, by holding down the Ctrl key and the right bracket at the same time. This brings up the familiar telnet&gt; prompt, at which point the word quit or close is entered.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I7" NAME="I7">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Machines in the Same Domain</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>If a user is connecting from a machine at, say, usask.ca to another machine at the same site, it is neccessary only to key the remote machine's name at the telnet prompt:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>open </B><I>machine-name</I></PRE>

<H4><A ID="I8" NAME="I8">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Using the </B><B><I>set</I></B><B> Command</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>Often, a user may be using telnet to connect to another machine (host 1) that, in turn, connects to a further machine (host 2). If the user keys the traditional escape key to leave host 2, then the connection to host 1 will also be lost. This may be 
quite inconvenient. Instead, the set command can be used to change the escape key on the local machine. At the telnet&gt; prompt, the following may be issued:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>set escape</B> <I>new-character</I></PRE>

<P>It is always wise to define the new key in such a way that it will not conflict with any keystroke available on the host or remote system.

<BR></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Using the </B><I>!</I><B> Command</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>At times it is neccessary to temporarily leave a telnet session in order to perform a task on the local machine. Here is an example. Suppose a user has used telnet to connect to an online catalog:

<BR></P>

<PRE>herald% <B>telnet</B>

telnet&gt; <B>open sundog</B></PRE>

<P>This puts the user into the remote site. In order to leave, the escape key is entered, bringing up the telnet&gt; prompt. The ! character is entered, and the user receives the local prompt again:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>!</B>

herald%</PRE>

<P>at which point local machine commands may be entered. When exit is keyed, the local prompt is returned. Hitting Enter again places the user back into the remote site.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I10" NAME="I10">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Nonstandard Port Numbers</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>When connecting to a remote computer with telnet, a user is automatically connected to port 23. This is the port reserved by UNIX systems for incoming telnet sessions. However, it is possible to telnet to another port to run certain applications. For 
example, if a user wanted to run the finger program on a remote system, the following command would be issued:

<BR></P>

<PRE>telnet&gt; <B>open herald 79</B></PRE>

<P>Once connected, the user merely hits the Return key to see who is currently logged in to that remote machine:

<BR></P>

<P>A local user can also receive specific information that a remote user has made public through his or her .plan file. For example, John A. Magliacane, of Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, &quot;publishes&quot; the <I>SpaceNews</I> online 
newsletter. To read it, the user types the following:

<P>Of course, regular UNIX users know that the finger program can accomplish the same task; I am merely pointing out the power that telnet has. It should be noted, however, that many non-UNIX users find that using telnet to port 79 is the only way to 
access such information, because remote fingering is not always possible.

<P>Most remote computers can be accessed with telnet, but there are still many around that need to be connected via tn3270. tn3270 allows a UNIX machine to connect to an IBM-mainframe machine, using full-screen and full-duplex emulation. Suppose, for 
example, a user needed to connect to the Pickler Memorial Library, Northeast Missouri State University, which has the Internet address academic.nemostate.edu. Telnetting to that address would connect the user but would not allow a public login. The user is 
instead presented with

<P>Users who wish to make telnet connections from their IBM personal computer may do so with NCSA Telnet. This software was developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Unlike the UNIX 
version, this client resides on a user's own personal computer, thus allowing direct access to other computers on the Internet running the TCP/IP protocols.

<BR></P>

<P>In order to run the software, the personal computer must have the following:

<BR></P>

<P>MS-DOS version 2.0 or later

<BR></P>

<P>An Ethernet adaptor board and cable

<BR></P>

<P>384KB memory (minimum)

<BR></P>

<PRE>ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu</PRE>

<P>After you log in to the site, change the directory to PC/Telnet/msdos. The files to receive are either tel2307b.zip or tel2307s.zip. The file tel2307b.zip is a PKZip 2.04 zipfile. It contains all the binaries and configuration files needed to run PC 
telnet and is 717,475 bytes in size.

<BR></P>

<P>The file tel2307s.zip is also a PKZip 2.04 zipfile. It contains all the source code used to compile all the binaries, and the makefiles. It is 679,778 bytes large. There are no binaries in the source distribution.

<P>It is essential that the config.tel file be edited, so that the machine's IP number can be listed. If editing this file is problematic, then a system administrator should be consulted. The administrator will also know if the machine has the correct 
Ethernet adaptor attached. Because the software resides on a personal computer, it can take advantage of the capabilities of the machine. For example, colors can be chosen, the clock set, and capture files can have names chosen.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Quitting a Remote Session</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>With NCSA Telnet, the simplest way to quit a single session is to log out of the remote machine, and be returned to the DOS prompt. However, it could be that there is no clear way of logging out. Just like the UNIX version of telnet, this program also 
has an escape key: Alt-X.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I18" NAME="I18">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Opening Multiple Sessions</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>So much for a single session. One of great strengths of NCSA Telnet is the ability to have more than one session live at any given time. There are two ways of performing this. First, a user can enter multiple machine names at the DOS prompt:

<BR></P>

<PRE>C:\ <B>telnet</B> <I>machine1</I> <I>machine2</I> <I>machine3</I></PRE>

<P>and be prompted for login and password information on each machine. The second way is to use Alt-A to add another session.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I19" NAME="I19">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>What the Status Line Indicates</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>The program uses VT100 terminal emulation. This means that only 24 of the screen's 25 lines are used by the terminal. The final line is used by the program to indicate the status of the sessions. Each session name is indicated in reverse video, with the 
current session shown on the far left. The far right of the screen is reserved to show whether scrollback, capture, or FTP is enabled.

<BR></P>

<H4><A ID="I20" NAME="I20">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>A Note on Hosts</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>The program can connect only to computers that have IP addresses. A user can find legal names by checking the config.tel file. This file can be configured to use the local domain-based name server to check names and addresses of machines. Like the UNIX 
version of telnet, this program enables a user to enter only the specific machine name (for example, willow, herald, or duke), providing they are all in the same domain&#151;in this case, usask.ca. If the IP numbers are known, then it is neccessary only to 
enter the last part of the number. So, if the local machine's number is 128.233.33.3 and the user wishes to connect to 128.233.33.7, then all that needs be entered is #7. Whereas UNIX allows a space between an IP address and a port number, this program 
requires that a pound sign (#) be inserted (for example, 128.233.33.3#5000).

<BR></P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<NOTE>

<IMG SRC="imp.gif"><B>Tip: </B>Watch for the asterisk to disappear to show that you are connected.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>It can sometimes take a couple of minutes to connect to a remote machine. While the connection is being made, an asterisk appears in the status box. This disappears when the connection is made. However, it may take further time for a login command to 
appear. At this point, it may make sense to break the connection with Alt-X and begin the procedure again.

<H4><A ID="I21" NAME="I21">

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Working with the Scrollback Feature</B>

<BR></FONT></A></H4>

<P>One of the most frustrating things about logging in to remote machines is that the information a user has received appears to drop off the top of the screen and be lost. NCSA Telnet has a very useful set of commands to enable a user to refer back to 
that information. This is all achieved by the Scroll Lock key. When depressed, that key enables a user to refer back to received information with Page Up, Page Down, and the up and down arrow keys. The information can not only be read but manipulated with 
cut-and-paste features. Here's how it works:

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>Hit the Scroll Lock key.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Place the cursor at the start of text to be copied.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press the Spacebar.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Move the cursor to the end of the text.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press the Spacebar.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press Alt-C to place text into the buffer.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Hit the Scroll Lock key.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Switch sessions with either Alt-B or Alt-N.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Move cursor to pasting position and press Alt-V.

<BR>

<BR></LI></OL>

<P>This procedure can also be accomplished with a mouse, but takes some dexterity:

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>Press the right mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Move to the start of the text to be copied.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press the left mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Move to the end of the text.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press left mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press and hold the left mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press the right mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Release both buttons. This copies the text into the buffer.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>To exit Scrollback, press the right mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI></OL>

<P>To paste the captured text, the user hits Alt-B or Alt-N to switch sessions. Then:

<BR></P>

<OL>

<LI>Press and hold the right mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Press left mouse button.

<BR>

<BR></LI>

<LI>Release both buttons.

<BR>

<BR></LI></OL>

<P>NCSA Telnet also enables a user to capture text to a file on the personal computer or to a printer. An entire session or just a single screen can be captured. The Alt-C key combination turns capture on and off and appends the text to the file designated 
in a user's parameters. To see the current name of the capture file and to change it if neccessary, Alt-P is depressed. This change can be made permanent by editing the config.tel file, which comes with the software.

<BR></P>

<P>Sometimes, a user may wish to capture only one screenful of information, particularly if that information is garbled by an Alt-C capture. To do this, use Alt-D. In any event, only one capture can occur at any given time. A user cannot capture text with 
Alt-C in one session and Alt-D in another. If the captured text is to be sent to a printer instead of a file, the user should enter PRN as the capture file name.

<BR></P>

<P>In order to edit the captured file&#151;and indeed, to perform other DOS commands&#151;NCSA Telnet includes a DOS Shell feature. This is controlled by Alt-E. Typing exit returns the user to the program. While in the DOS shell, a user may run other 
programs. However, any other program that wants to use the Ethernet connection will cause NCSA Telnet to crash. Other programs also may cause crashes. Learning which programs to avoid using is a matter of trial and error. Also, trying to run programs that 
consume lots of random-access memory may cause problems.

<P>The config.tel file determines how NCSA Telnet will run. It is a text file that can be easily edited with a DOS text editor. Some instructions may not be clear to novices, however, in which case a systems person should be consulted for advice. Some 
parameters&#151;for example, screen colors, capture-file name, terminal type, and so on&#151;can be changed while in the program. Depressing Alt-P brings up the following:

<IMG SRC="note.gif"><B>Note: </B>A username <I>must</I> be entered if making an rlogin connection.

<BR></NOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>Both telnet and rlogin connections function similarly to their UNIX counterparts; that is, telnet connects to port 23 of the remote machine, while rlogin connects to port 513. But while UNIX rlogin requires a user to key -L <I>username</I>, WinQVT/Net 
accepts just the user's name. Also, if the connection requires another remote port number, then it can be added in the IP Port box.

<BR></P>

<P>Notice the large box on the right of Figure 8.3. This is the hosts list, which was created in the qvtnet.rc file. In this example, all machine names are local, meaning they belong to the usask.ca domain. However, any valid Internet address can be added 
to the file. By selecting the entry for the remote machine herald and clicking OK, a connection is made, bringing up the login: prompt, as shown in Figure 8.4.

<P>WinQVT/Net's terminal sessions allow screen capture, logging a session to a file, the execution of scripts, cut and paste from one session to another, color and font selection, and the ability to redefine keys. Being a Windows-compatible program, 
WinQVT/Net can also be used by such Worldwide Web browsers as Cello and Mosaic when spawning telnet sessions. It is a good idea to have it included in the Windows StartUp window, so that it loads automatically at login time.

<P>Version 6.7 is a major upgrade. Much redundant information has been deleted, and errors have been corrected. All the new/updated files created since Version 6.6 have also been incorporated. The unzipped files total over 1.2 MB. . .but remember, you can 
always edit out any information you do not need, in order to save space.

<P>The Hytelnet program is archived using a PKZIP.EXE. To unarchive it, you must be able to unzip the file. If you have the file PKUNZIP.EXE, it will unarchive the hyteln67.zip file. If you do not have it, you may retrieve it by following these

<P>Because of the plethora of PC communications programs, I will not attempt to give step-by-step instructions on how to download to your PC. You should check the instructions for your software for downloading a binary file from your Internet account to 
your PC.

<BR></P>

<P>To Unarchive hyteln67.zip, make a new directory on your hard disk (for example, mkdir hytelnet) Copy PKUNZIP.EXE or UNZIP.EXE and hyteln67.zip into the new directory. Make sure you are in that directory, then enter pkunzip hyteln67.zip. This will 
unarchive hyteln67.zip, which contains the following files:

<BR></P>

<PRE>HYTELNET.ZIP

READNOW</PRE>

<P>The file READNOW gives full instructions for unarchiving HYTELNET.ZIP. Simply put, you <I>MUST</I> unZIP the file with the -d parameter (if you are using PKUNZIP.EXE) so that all the subdirectories will be recursed. If you are using UNZIP.EXE, no 
parameters are required.

<BR></P>

<P>To use Hytelnet, you should refer to the instructions in the release announcement or to the README file included with the package.

<BR></P>

<P>Please note that I offer these instructions as a service for those who are unfamiliar with the steps required to download and use files from network sources. I cannot be responsible for any local variations in these procedures that may exist. Please 
contact your local computer support staff if you have difficulty performing these tasks.

<BR></P>

<P>The UNIX/VMS version, created by Earl Fogel, is available for browsing by telnet to access.usask.ca; login with hytelnet (all lowercase). For more information on this version, contact Earl at fogel@herald.usask.ca.</P>
